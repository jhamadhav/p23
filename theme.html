          We look into the mirror and all we see is a corporate dud who gave up to the rat race, surfing the past all you see is-us there smiling-and all it does is haunt you. Why sabotage your true self just to earn something that won't even last with you?Why vandalize your uniqueness your creativity, something that you dreamt as a child? Go read that book that's been napping there on your shelf, go hug your people the ones that need some love, go paint that painting that is thirsty, quenching for colours, go live that life that you've always dreamt to live

          The theme focuses on discovering your true self, the self that you imagined yourself to be in the childhood looking out of the window, staring at the sky laying on wet grass hoping one day, to be something and someone who makes people's life better. Who loves people, and importantly loves himself. At last mere yaar, Dil khush jaha teri to manzil h vahi!
